REACT
=>our chrome browser wont understand the jsx so babel converst the jsx to normal vanila javascript code which our chrome browser will undersatnd

states
it allow us manage and isplay changing data in our application
state is used to tell react to watch this variable and if any changes then reflect  on the DOM

Hookes
are funntction to use some react features in functional compoenents
are the the functions that makes functional components work like class functions
=================================================================================================
useState hook
is a function to add state in functional component
whenever u want to use variable u can use useState hook
======================================================================================================
useEffect 
What is useEffect?

In simple words:
useEffect is used to perform “side effects” in a React component.

❓ What are side effects?
Anything that is not directly UI rendering.

Examples:
Fetching data from an API
Updating the browser title
Setting a timer (setTimeout, setInterval)
Subscribing/unsubscribing to something
Accessing DOM
Calling setState after render
👉 Rendering = showing UI
👉 Side effect = doing extra work after UI is shown

🔹 Why does React need useEffect?

React works like this:
Component renders UI
React updates the DOM
Then side effects should run

If React allowed side effects directly inside render:
Infinite loops
Unpredictable UI
Performance issues

So React says:
“First render UI.
Then I’ll give you useEffect to run side effects safely.”

Every time state changes, React does this:
Re-runs the entire component function
Recalculates JSX
Updates the DOM if needed
Then runs useEffect 
===================================================================================================
cleanups with useefffect
Whenever count changes, stop the old timer that knows the old count, and start a new timer that knows the new count.
=============================================================================================
useContext
What is useContext? (In simple words)

useContext is a React hook used to share data globally between components without passing props manually at every level.
It solves the problem called props drilling.

========================================================================================
What are Props? 

Props (properties) are how a parent component sends data to a child component.
Think of props as:
👉 function parameters, but for components.

🔹 Basic Rule of Props (VERY IMPORTANT)
Data flows from parent → child only
(One-way data flow)
Child ❌ cannot change props directly

Complete Example (Simple & Clear)
📁 App.jsx (Parent)
function App() {
  return <Student name="Meghana" branch="CSE" />;
}

📁 Student.jsx (Child)
function Student({ name, branch }) {
  return <p>{name} studies {branch}</p>;
